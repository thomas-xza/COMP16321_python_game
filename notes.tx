OVERVIEW
--------

10 types of boats
10 countries
2 types of races - single points or double points
1st place = 1*race_type points, 10th place = 10*race_type points

Lowest points total is winner.

Data structure of input:
[boat type][race type] - [first_place] - [second_place] - [third_place] ..

INITIAL THOUGHTS
----------------

"Good programmers think about the data structures, bad programmers think about the code"
- Linus Torvalds

To write unit tests, will probably be easier to build outside of the race_condition.py file, and then fit it into the class.


PLANNED DATA STRUCTURES
-----------------------

The task sections orient around the data in different ways.

Initial data:
races_data[race_n]['race attribute'] = reformat(arr_of_strings)

Section 2:
Select by boat type, race type

Section 3:
Select by boat type, country type

Section 4:
Similar to Section 3, but with exceptions

Section 5:
OASelect by country
